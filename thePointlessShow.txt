have something in your hand and make people pay for it.

Mistakes are free but it costs a lot to pay for it.
Learn to love on command. Love is to be seen. To be recognissed. It is beyond the feelings.

Every human being is a puzzle of need. Be the missing piece and they will give you everything you want.

I would have died just to see you live. (This love statement makes no sense).

Generousity is a mask to hide our selfishness.

If you learn something, apply it towards
something which brings insight and personal power towards your short and
long-term goals. 

Wisdom is obtained from the experience and insight gained
in applying knowledge to a result.
